# Web-Scraping-with-Python
Web Scraping Real Estate Data with Python library "BeautifulSoup"

## introduction
This project demonstrates how to scrape real estate data from a multi-page listing website using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas. The data is collected from a property listings website covering 139 pages. Each page provides detailed information about various properties in Chicago, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and listing prices.
